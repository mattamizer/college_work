The code is very usable. The user passes in an array of Comparable items and the method sorts it.


The code also appears to be complete. If all the customer wants is a sorted array then this code is very complete.


I cannot say if the code is robust or not, I would have to run some tests on it.


The code is time efficient, but will use a lot of memory with larger arrays that need to be sorted.


The code scales well, it should perform just as well on small or extremely large arrays.


The code is certainly easy to read. It is commented well and the variable names make sense.


It can be reused for different types of elements in the array, but it will never do anything but sort.


The design is very simple, which is really beneficial.


The code is also maintainable. It would be easy to implement new features of fix any bugs.


The code appears to be extensible, though I'm not sure why you would want to extend a sorting algorithm.
